Delivery companies with a fleet of trucks and customers in different locations face the challenge of minimizing both delivery time and cost. This is a complex problem that requires finding the shortest possible trip length for all trucks. To tackle this challenge, we utilized combinatorial optimization methods and Qiskit quantum computing. 

Our approach involved filtering a dataset of US city locations as depot and customer locations. The main challenge is minimizing the distance vehicles travel while designing routes connecting depots to multiple client locations and back to the depot. 

We utilized a Qiskit-coded vehicle routing problem (VRP) solution to obtain the optimal solution. Our algorithm solution efficiently reduces delivery time and cost while ensuring the shortest possible distance traveled by all vehicles.
